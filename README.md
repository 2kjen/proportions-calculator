# Proportions Calculator

**Purpose:**

The Proportions Calculator helps you to calculate dimensions when you want to resize an image
(or any other object) whilst maintaining existing proportions.

**Why did I create this?**

This program was inspired by the 'Scale Image' feature on GIMP. 

I was trying to resize an image in the README file on my Github profile but couldn't be bothered
to load GIMP to use the 'Scale Image' feature. I saw a post somewhere saying that beginner programmers
should create programs that make their lives easier. I put two and two together and created a
program that allowed me to calculate dimensions of the same proportions without loading GIMP.
